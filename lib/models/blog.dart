        "Going into my internship, I didn’t have many expectations, but I quickly realized how different the real world is from school. The experience was challenging, with a constant grind of tasks and deadlines, leaving no room for idleness. Despite the tough pace, I learned a lot, especially about the importance of documentation and having a structured plan. I explored Google ML Kit, particularly its barcode scanning capabilities, and successfully applied it to create working prototypes. This involved developing and testing multiple concepts tailored to different scenarios, such as inventory management and retail, ensuring the solutions addressed specific customer needs while being user-friendly and efficient. Additionally, I worked with OpenCV in Python, focusing on image processing techniques like Canny edge detection. This method, widely used for detecting edges in images, enabled me to analyze and process visual data effectively. I experimented with various parameters such as thresholds and Gaussian blur to fine-tune the detection process, making it adaptable to diverse lighting conditions and image qualities. These skills proved instrumental in building AI-powered applications with enhanced visual analysis.  Additionally, I dabbled in UI/UX, focusing on enhancing the user experience. My mentor played a significant role in my growth, teaching me that mistakes are just as valuable as successes, as they provide crucial learning opportunities.",

        "ReGain is an innovative marketplace mobile app designed to revolutionize the recycling process by bridging the gap between households and the waste sector. Every day, many households face challenges in properly disposing of recyclables, while junk shops and waste pickers struggle with limited access to materials, often leading to financial difficulties. ReGain provides a streamlined solution by connecting households directly with junk shops and waste pickers, creating a simple and efficient process to sell and acquire recyclable materials. This creates a win-win situation: households can recycle responsibly, and waste sector workers gain increased financial opportunities. Essentially, ReGain operates as a buying-and-selling platform for junk shops and households—imagine an e-commerce marketplace where everyone can trade and sell their trash responsibly. It’s a platform that not only simplifies waste management but also fosters a sense of community by making recycling a collaborative effort to create a cleaner and better environment. One of the key lessons I learned during this project was the importance of choosing the right teammates. At the start, I didn’t know many people, but I was fortunate to find an incredible group. We rarely argued, and it’s hard to explain, but everything just clicked—everyone understood their roles and executed them perfectly, like it was meant to be. To my groupmates Rae, Ashley, and Stan, thank you for an unforgettable four terms of thesis work. It was a challenging yet rewarding journey, and I wish you all the best in your future endeavors. ~~ Love, Simon",

        "There was a time when I almost gave up on college and programming. I went through a dark period where I cared little about my academics—barely passing or even failing some of my subjects. I felt tired and unmotivated, constantly questioning whether I should continue pursuing programming at all. However, here I am now, having passed my thesis, completed my internship, and waiting for graduation. It’s a milestone I once thought I wouldn’t reach. Looking back, I realize that a shift in perspective made all the difference. At some point, I began to see things in a more optimistic light. I started talking to more people, joining organizations, and pushing myself to test my limits. These small steps helped me rebuild my confidence and reignite my passion for learning. While I’ve always been afraid of the future and hesitant to step into uncertainty, I now understand that uncertainty is what makes life interesting. There’s no prize for achieving perfection—only an end to the pursuit. Embracing this mindset has made me appreciate the journey, with all its twists and turns, for the growth and lessons it brings. Moving forward, I will continue to pursue my long-term goal of creating something revolutionary that changes the way we do certain things. While I am not yet sure what that will be, I feel optimistic about what the future holds. I’m ready to embrace the challenges and opportunities ahead, knowing that each step brings me closer to turning that vision into reality.",

        "Outside of school, I’ve been actively involved in volunteer work with a non-profit organization called the Tzu Chi Foundation. Since joining as a Tzu Chi Youth in 2016, I’ve had the privilege of participating in various meaningful activities, such as recycling programs, disaster relief efforts, and initiatives to provide education to underprivileged scholars. These experiences have allowed me to witness firsthand the power of collective action in creating positive change in both local communities and the environment. Through my time with Tzu Chi, I’ve grown in countless ways. I’ve learned the importance of responsibility and developed essential skills in leadership, effective communication, and public speaking. Volunteering has also taught me to work with people from different walks of life, encouraging collaboration and understanding. Most importantly, I’ve developed a deep sense of compassion—both for others and for the environment. This compassion has shaped how I view the world, inspiring me to make a difference, no matter how small the effort might seem. My journey with Tzu Chi has been one of growth and self-discovery. It has reminded me that small acts of kindness and commitment can ripple outward, inspiring others and contributing to a better future for everyone. These lessons continue to influence not just my volunteer work but also how I approach challenges in other areas of my life, as I strive to combine compassion and innovation in everything I do.",
